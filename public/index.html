            <p class="blog-post-meta">April 2020</p>

            <h4 class="title">Final Visualization</h4>

            <p> My current research is focusing on the best way to understand near real-time (NRT) monitoring of 
              deforestation such that we can more effectively mitigate illegal logging. At the end of these 4 years,
              I plan to have an app that forest managers can use showing probability of deforestation across a landscape.
              The case will be something like this: there is a map made up of 10m pixels that are all blue, indicating 
              low probability of deforestation. Suddenly, the next day one pixel is dark red, while the pixels around it extending
              to a 25km diameter circle are brightening shades toward blue. This indicates that last night, someone cut down
              trees in the dark red pixel, and now because of that, the surrounding pixels have an elevated risk of deforestation
              compared to before.
             </p>

             <p>As I currently don't have the data or code for this yet, I decided to create a proxy:</p>
             <iframe src="../final_vis.html" frameboarder=0 style="width: 100%; height: 600px;" ></iframe>

             <h3 class="title">Methods</h3>
             <p>
               The data shown here is NDVI for late December 2018 - January 2020 as obtained from cloud-masked Landsat 8
               Collection 1 Surface Reflectance Tier 1 via Google Earth Engine 
               (see <a href="https://code.earthengine.google.com/8180a8ca4817cdf0b312464b17d9188d"> 
                this link</a> for example code, and scroll down on the right panel to see some charts). 
               Each circle's size relates to the size of the 
               disturbance itself, with larger disturbances (more deforestation) having the larger circles. I should note
               the size range of 5-25km is completely arbitrary given my lack of full understanding at this point. I decided to 
               double-encode the meaning of the circles as well, by showing both size and color differences. Originally I was going to
               use a single red color, but I quickly realized it was near impossible to accurately distinguish the individual sizes.
               I was also going to have both circles and markers to show the points, but I decided against it after seeing how the 
               markers obscured the circles themselves. With some of the points already very small, this was not ideal.
             </p>

             <h3 class="title">Challenges</h3>
             <p>
               Originally I was going to make this visualization using Shiny in R, but I was having problems with hosting via
               shiny-apps.io, so I abandoned it and moved to htmlwidgets instead. The final product here relies heavily on the
               "leaftime" package, for whose existence I'm grateful. Some challenges were present along the way, however. For example,
               as long as it took me to figure out the Google Earth Engine code, it took me nearly as long (or what felt nearly as 
               long) to tweak Shiny and htmlwidgets to work within R. One aspect I was keen on adding was having small lightning bolt
               markers pop up when there was a confirmed disturbance in the data, but unfortunately I was unable to get this to work.

              several labs including <a href="./clock/clock.html"> this clock</a> I made as well as 
            my five sheet design images below. I also created some Tableau
